# AUSAM

v2 - incorporates scholarly activity tracker + board cert checker + PD state licence checker

## Updates:
**2018-10:**
* Updated code to support ACGME's reformatted "Print Annual Update" page
* Improve board cert extraction code, now supports multiple boards and works well. Tested with HFH EM, EMIM, EMIMCCM, TY and all faculty are being picked up
* ABANDONED: PDFs simply do not have enough information in them to return tables properly. Extracting any data that makes sense is pointless

## Issues:
**2018-10:**
* Does not work off PDF version, as text is formatted differently
