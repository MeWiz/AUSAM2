Major Changes And Other Updates
Provide a brief update explaining any major changes to the training program since the last academic year, including changes in leadership. This may also include improvements and/or innovations implemented to address potential issues identified during the annual program review. (Last Updated: 8/14/2018)

We have established closer relationship with the Henry Ford Hospital Dermatology & Radiation Oncology Residency Program in order to retain residents for PGY1 at our program and subsequent years at the same institution.

Residents were given the option of doing an additional month of Emergency Medicine with focus on less acute patients, such as those coming with rashes or minor eye complaints. This has been well received.
